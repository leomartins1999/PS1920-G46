\section*{Abstract}
% Parágrafo intro
Nowadays, volunteering is an activity that has been gaining more prominence.
Being a volunteer promotes not only the enrichment of society but also solidarity and the value of social environments. The participation in these activities allows the volunteer to develop skills such as leadership and teamwork, which are valuable in a professional environment. \par \smallskip
% Parágrafo problemática
The divulgation and enrollment in these actions is done through social networks, which aren't developed with this intent in mind, and in websites, which leads to a decentralization of information. \par \smallskip
% Parágrafo descrição do projeto
Our project looks to solve these issues through the development of a social network focused on volunteering, where volunteers and organizations coexist, giving focus to the divulgation and enrollment in these actions while maintaining the typical aspects of a social network (interaction between users). The project will be composed of a REST API (Javascript) and two client applications: a mobile app (Android), for the volunteers, and a web app (React), for the organizations. \par \smallskip
